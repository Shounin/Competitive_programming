# Competitive_programming
Various assignments I handed in during the course Effective Programming and Problem Solving (T-414-AFLV) at Reykjavík University in spring semester 2014.
Code examples and various assistance was provided by Bjarki Ágúst Guðmundsson and Tómas Ken Magnússon.

*Note that these assignments were intended for competitive programming, so speed and efficiency were considered more important than readability*
